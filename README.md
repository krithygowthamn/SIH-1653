## Problem Title
MediTrack: Medicine Expiry and Donation Alert System
## Problem Description
Background: In many households, unused medicines often accumulate and are eventually thrown away after expiration. This not only results in financial waste but also poses environmental risks when disposed of improperly. At the same time, a large segment of the population—especially in rural and low-income urban areas—faces difficulty in accessing basic medications due to affordability or availability. While NGOs and charitable clinics work to support these communities, they often lack a steady supply of essential medicines. A system that allows individuals to track their medicines’ expiry dates and safely donate unexpired, unused ones can help bridge this gap. Such a solution would reduce medicine waste, promote responsible usage, and support public health in underserved areas.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

## Idea
Medicine Entry & Tracking
Users can add medicines by name or barcode, with expiry dates, and get automatic alerts before expiry.

Expiry Notification System
The app sends timely reminders (via app notification or SMS) to use or donate medicines before they expire.

Donation Eligibility Check
The system checks if a medicine is unopened, not expired, and safe to donate before allowing it for donation.

Nearby Donation Centers Locator
Users can view and contact nearby NGOs, clinics, or pharmacies that accept medicine donations using a built-in map.

Donation Process & Confirmation
Donors can mark medicines for donation, generate a QR code, or request a pickup, and receive confirmation once accepted.

Awareness and Education
The platform includes tips on medicine storage, responsible usage, and proper disposal of expired medicines.

Multilingual and User-Friendly Interface
Designed for accessibility, especially in rural and senior populations, with support for regional languages.
